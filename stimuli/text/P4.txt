All animals that live on other animals face the problem of how to get hold of\ntheir prey. Many animals seek and hunt their prey, while others sit still and wait\nfor a harmless victim to come close to them. One widely used way to get food\nwithout too much trouble is to build a trap or net. The best known example for\nanimals that catch other animals with the help of a net are spiders. Their sticky\nnets are spun so fine that they are hard to see, and usually an insect does not\nnotice a net until it has caught itself in it. The spider then only needs to go to the\nplace where the insect is. It is either eaten right on the spot or otherwise it is\nwrapped in sticky threads for later consumption. Other living things that are stuck\non rocks or on the floor of the sea live on tiny animals and plants that they soak\nin with water.

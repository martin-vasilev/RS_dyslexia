In a small town a greengrocer had opened a shop that was located above a deep\ncellar. Every night, mice came in droves out of this cellar into the shop. They ate\napples and pears, grapes and nuts and did not spare the vegetables and potatoes\neither. No goods that were in the shop were safe from the small intrusive rodents\nbetween midnight and sunrise. As long as there was noise in the streets at night\nand cars were driving by, the mice still stayed quietly in the cellar. But as soon as\nthe old clock on the town hall had struck midnight and it became quiet in the\nstreet, they came out in droves, enjoyed the sweet fruits and celebrated real\nfeasts, whose remains filled the owner with despair every morning when he\nentered the shop. So he tried to protect himself against the mice. At first he set\nup traps all over the shop.

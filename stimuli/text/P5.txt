In areas where it is very hot and dry, plants and animals have to adapt to these\nconditions. Many plants survive times of drought in the form of seeds which often\nlie buried in the ground for several years and do not put out shoots before it rains.\nWhen that happens, the plants grow very quickly and form flowers and seeds,\nwhich in due time develop into the next generation. Some animals behave in a\nsimilar way. There are frogs that bury themselves in the ground and form a capsule\nwhich prevents them from drying out. These frogs only come to the surface when\nit finally rains. They use this time in which water is available to provide for their\noffspring. A lot of plants in the desert have adapted to the dryness in other ways.\nSome have extensive roots that take in water from a large area or reach into the\nground very far.

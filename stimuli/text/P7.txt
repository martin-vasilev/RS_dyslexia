The word island describes areas that are cut off from land and are surrounded by\nthe sea on all sides. Islands can come into existence when volcanoes rise from the\nfloor of the sea or when the water level rises or falls. A number of islands came\ninto existence at the end of the last ice age. As the ice melted, the water ran into\nthe sea, whose level rose so much as a result of this that low lying land was\nflooded. Today only the highest points stick out of the sea as islands. Animals and\nplants that have managed to reach a remote island in some way normally cannot\nleave it anymore. If they want to stay alive, they have to adapt to the new\nenvironment very quickly. For living things that are native to islands, there is\nalways a danger that they may become extinct when new animals arrive or human\nbeings start to interfere.

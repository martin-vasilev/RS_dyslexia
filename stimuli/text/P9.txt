Animals and plants that live in areas with a cold or temperate climate have to find\nways and means to survive the winter months. Many plants hibernate in the form\nof seeds which will then shoot in spring and develop into new plants. There are\nother plants whose parts above the ground die, and as it gets warmer in spring\nthey form new shoots again. Many trees and bushes lose their leaves in autumn\nand have a resting period during winter. Because animals move around, they\nconsume substantially more energy than plants. Most animals survive winter\nwithout changing their usual way of life. But there are also a number of animals\nthat have to take special precautions so that they will not freeze to death. Some\nbirds have solved this problem by flying away in autumn to spend the winter\nmonths in more pleasant areas in the south.

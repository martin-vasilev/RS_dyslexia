In the past, it was assumed that spiders were somehow able to protect\nthemselves from the sticky substance in their own nets, while flies and other\ninsects did not have this protection. But new scientific findings show that this is\nnot true. A spider would also get caught in its net if it did not make use of a\nclever trick. Spiders can produce two different kinds of threads. Thus, spiders\nfirst build a net out of dry threads which do not stick. When this net is finished,\nthe spider spins the sticky material on top of it. Only this net on top of the net\ncatches the insects that land on it. In order not to be put out of action itself, the\nspider leaves parts of the net free of sticky material. These spots are placed in\nsuch a clever way that the spider can reach every point of its net without\ngetting caught in it itself.

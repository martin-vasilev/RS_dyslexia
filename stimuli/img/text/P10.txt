The colours of an animal or a plant are generally there for some purpose. The\nvisual perception of colours is well developed in the case of birds, and among a lot\nof species the males wear a colourful outfit to please the females. Plants often\nhave coloured flowers to attract insects, which help them to reproduce. Some\nanimals that are poisonous or taste unpleasant wear striking colours as warning.\nWasps, for instance, can easily be recognised by their yellow and black stripes,\nand birds learn quickly that they will be stung if they attack insects wearing these\nstripes. But not all colourful animals are poisonous. There are harmless flies that\ndo not have a sting but imitate wasps. Other animals protect themselves by\nmaking themselves almost invisible. They look like the leaves, the ground or the\nrocks on which they live.

Trees grow almost everywhere except in permanent ice and snow, on the tops of\nhigh mountains and in deserts. If an empty piece of land is left to itself for long\nenough, after some time trees will start to grow. At first, the ground is covered\nwith low plants. Later, bushes grow and in their shade, some of the lower plants\nthat had established themselves first, then die. When still more time has passed,\ntrees start to grow. As they grow bigger, some of the bushes are caught in the\nshade of the bigger trees and die. In this way, a forest develops over time. Most\ntrees grow slowly, and a number of them can become very old. When old trees die,\nyoung ones appear that take their place. Forests are a habitat that can exist for a\nvery long time without changing. It depends on the climate which trees can be\nfound in a certain area.

The beaver is an excellent swimmer. It can achieve a speed of up to seven miles\nper hour in water. Its protection against the cold consists of a skin with thousands\nof single hairs and a thick layer of fat. With its big lungs it can easily stay under\nwater for more than twenty minutes. The beaver is not only skillful in felling\ntrees, but also an experienced craftsman in building dams. When the beaver fells a\ntree, it gnaws on the trunk in such a way that the upper and the lower part of the\ntrunk are only connected with each other at a small point. When the connection is\nnarrow and the beaver has become tired, the wind will do the rest. The twigs and\nthin branches are cut off by the beaver and piled up near its den, which is built on\na small island. The thick branches are sorted out and used as wood for building\ndams.

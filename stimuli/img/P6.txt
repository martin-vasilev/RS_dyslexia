One of the many things that threaten animals and plants alike is the danger of\nbeing eaten. Some animals take recourse in camouflaging themselves, while\nothers hide away. A number of them can flyaway and others are so fast that they\ncan flee from their enemies. Plants, which as is well known cannot run away, have\ndeveloped other means to protect themselves. These include sharp spines and\nthorns or a tough skin. Other plants and also a number of animals protect\nthemselves by poisons that they contain. These poisons need not necessarily be\ndeadly. It is sufficient if they prevent other animals from eating the poisonous\nbeings. Some animals even protect themselves by looking like others that contain\npoisonous substances. In the animal kingdom, a particularly striking colour\ngenerally signals that the animal is inedible.
